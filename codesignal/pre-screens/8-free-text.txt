In as much detail as you can, describe what happens behind the scenes when you visit a webpage in your browser.

The browser starts by finding the IP address corresponding to the URL sought by retrieving that information from a DNS (Domain Name Server).
Then, the browser calls the server locating at the retrieved IP address and asks a copy of the website using the TCP/IP protocol.
If the server doesn't encounter any error and allows the website to be retrieved, it sends a "200 OK" status response code to the browser indicating that the website can be retrieved.
Then, the server sends all the files forming the website to the browser in a series of data packets.
Once all the data packets have been received by the browser, the browser assembles them to recreate all the files forming the website.
Finally, the browser uses a browser engine to render the website on the screen based to the files received.
